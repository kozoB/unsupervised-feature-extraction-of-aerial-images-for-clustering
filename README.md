# unsupervised-feature-extraction-of-aerial-images-for-clustering
This project implements the core method from the paper “Unsupervised feature extraction of aerial images for clustering and understanding hazardous road segments” using the Aerial Imagery Semantic Segmentation Dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to learn unsupervised latent features from aerial images that capture differences in the built environment - such as roads, residential areas, natural landscapes, and infrastructure - and to cluster these images into meaningful groups without any labels. We load and preprocess the images, train a convolutional autoencoder to learn compressed feature representations, reduce the features with PCA, and perform Agglomerative Clustering to identify visually and semantically coherent categories of urban form, reproducing the paper’s feature extraction and clustering pipeline on a different open aerial imagery dataset
